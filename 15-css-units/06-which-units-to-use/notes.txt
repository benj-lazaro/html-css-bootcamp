Which units to use & when?
--------------------------

px
==
- For small details e.g. borders & shadows
- Avoid for font-size property as it does not scale & not responsive
- Small ajustment without caring about scaling very much

rem / em
========
- For font-size, padding & margin properties
- Scalable and responsive
- rem keeps the font-size relative to other elements
- em keeps the font-size relative to its parent element

% (percent)
===========
- For defining layouts, heights and widths
- Not much need when using Flexbox or Grid

vh / vw
=======
- For larger layout concerns
- Usually when wanting to take the full height / width of the viewport or make an overlay
