Animation Performance
=====================
- If you care about performance, NOT all CSS properties are advised to be animated
- Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties)

- Certain CSS properties impacts certain stages of the browser rendering process
    - Animating CSS properties such as margin, width
    - Forces the browser to do a layout recalculation, repainting and re-compositing

    - Animating CSS properpeties such as color and color-background
    - Forces the browser to re-paint and re-composite

- The most animatable CSS property is opacity and transform
    - Skips the Layout and Painting phases
    - Forces the browser to perform re-composition ONLY
    - It has the LOWEST impact and offers the highest performance
